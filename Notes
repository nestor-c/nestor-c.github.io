-Floats take elements out of the flow of DOM.

-Width and Height attribute only affect the content area.

-Inline elements:

   respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
   cannot have a width and height set
   allow other elements to sit to their left and right.
   see very important side notes on this here.

-Block elements:

   respect all of those
   force a line break after the block element
   acquires full-width if width not defined

-Inline-block elements:

   allow other elements to sit to their left and right
   respect top & bottom margins and padding
   respect height and width
